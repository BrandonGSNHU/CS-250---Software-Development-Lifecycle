# CS-250---Software-Development-Lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

 -  Creating user stories allow programmers to pinpoint exactly what a customer is requesting or looking for. This cuts out a lot of guess work on our part and gives the customer a final product as close to their vision as possible. In Agile SCRUM this is facilitated by the product owner and really helps programmers with their work and finishing it as quickly and efficiently as possible.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

 -  I'm still very fresh into developing any programs and coding can be a little confusing for me. My plan of action for tackling projects still needs to be defined but I start out with planning out what the project requires. What is my end goal and from there I can break it down into individual parts to reach that goal. I hope to incorporate both processes, waterfall and agile, in my work. With my current lack of experience I feel agile will help me fix mistakes faster and easier but both are excellent tools.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

 -  A good team member in software development is a lot like a good team member in any team. Communicating, being open, and helping teammates out are all crucial skills and habits to have in a team. The team is working together to finish a project or a goal and is only as good as their weakest member. If the team consistently works together and helps each other then there is no weakest member but only a unit of success. Software development requires a lot of communication and revising. Without team work nothing would get done in any reasonable amount of time.
